The Chatbot is a conversational agent which talk with a user and provide answers to the users requests independently of the human intervention. In this project I have created Chabot using rasa framework. Rasa is a tool to build custom AI chatbots using Python and natural language understanding (NLU). It also allows the user to train the model and add custom actions.
